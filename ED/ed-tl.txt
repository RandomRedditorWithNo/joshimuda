Noisy and loud
But still endearing
The laughter from that day
A story that can't be rewound
The thing about youth is,
it's always light and shadows
Inside the darkness
An inferior shining star
Looking back is complicated
Far too beautiful days
Springtime has always passed by unexpectedly by then
Your words reverberate in my heart
Springtime will take it all away someday
Until that day, being stupid is fine
Because I'll run past it
