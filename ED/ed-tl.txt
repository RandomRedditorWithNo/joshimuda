Clamorous and noisy
But still charming
The laughter from that day
A story that can't be rewound
The thing about youth is,
it's always light and shadows
Inside the darkness
A dim star that shines
Looking back doesn't help at all
It was way too good back then
Spring was over before you knew it
Your words reverberate in my heart
Until that day, being stupid is fine
Because I'll run through it
