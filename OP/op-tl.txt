Yo
Mic check
High school girl
Huh?
Okay! Isn't that usually where one two is best?
So the moon is a quiet beast during the daytime
What about the moon? That's suddenly out of the blue
Once it becomes night, under the cover of darkness
There you go being sparkly, wallflower
I want to be like you, lunatic girls
I want to jump on that bandwagon, sparkly high school girl
Always lazing around as the status quo is okay!
Totally empty your mind
If you do that, you'll be efficient
Is that so? You know? Wild instinct (Rawr!)
A word to society
A maiden's roar, ro-ro-ro-ro-round!
Innovative shout, ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-round!
So there's no rabbit on the moon, huh?
So dass is German, huh?
A soundtrack that makes you want to eat spicy curry while you cry!
Ooh round! Moon! Dass! Cry!
Gather round
Ooh round! Moon! Dass! Cry!
Mic check, high school girl, one two
High school girl, one two
Anything's okay, everyday
Ooh round! Moon! Dass! Cry!
Take a breath
Ooh round! Moon! Dass! Cry!
Sushi, ramen, beef bowl, pork cutlet, kishimen noodles
A soundtrack that makes you want to eat anything
Don't ever begrudge individuality
A smoldering instinct, everyone gather round!
Surprise it towards an unseen direction
Let's go even if it's pointless, it'll be treasure before long
Ooh round! Moon! Dass! Cry!
When you want to cry...
Ooh round! Moon! Dass! Cry!
Wholeheartedly cry and cry. It's gratifying
Every day feels refreshing
Ooh round! Moon! Dass! Cry!
So, after that...
Ooh round! Moon! Dass! Cry!
Even if you don't want to, you'll cheer up and smile for sure
Round! Moon! Dass! Cry! Everyday
