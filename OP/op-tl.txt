Mic check
HS Girl
Huh?
Okay! Isn't that usually where one two goes?
The moon is a sleeping giant at night
Switch up to the moon?
We move in silence at dusk
There you go, standing out, wallflower
You're inspiring, crazy girls
I wanna be like you, shining girl
Doing nothing all the time is perfectly fine
Reset your mind
That'll keep you the ball
Really? For real? It's a feral feel
A message to society
A maiden's roar, wawawawawa
A brand new cry, wawawawawa
There really ain't a man on the moon huh?
So Voll is German, huh?
A beat that makes you wanna eat curry so spicy you could die
Ooh wee! Wane! Voll! Dies
Gather round
Ooh wee! Wane! Voll! Dies
Mic check, HS Girl, one two
HS Girl, one two
Whatever's okay, everyday
Ooh wee! Wane! Voll! Dies
Take a breath
Ooh wee! Wane! Voll! Dies
Sushi, ramen, beef bowl, pork cutlet, kishimen noodles
I'll eat whatever to this beat
It's always admirable to try and stand out!
Burning instinct, gather round!
Show off something completely original
No worries let's go, one man's trash is treasure to some
Ooh wee! Wane! Voll! Dies
When you wanna cry...
Ooh wee! Wane! Voll! Dies
Crying is all right, let it all out!
Every day is a brand new day
Ooh wee! Wane! Voll! Dies
So, after that...
Ooh wee! Wane! Voll! Dies
You can resist all you want but you'll smile for sure!
Ooh wee! Wane! Voll! Dies! Everyday
