Huh?\
Okay! Isn\'92t that usually where one two goes?\
The moon is a sleeping giant at night\
Switch up to the moon?\
We move in silence at dusk\
There you go, standing out, wallflower\
You\'92re inspiring, crazy girls\
I wanna be like you, shining girl\
Doing nothing all the time is perfectly fine\
Reset your mind\
That\'92ll keep you the ball\/Users/soroushhashemloo/Documents/joshimuda/OP/op-tl.txt
Really? For real? It\'92s a feral feel\
A message to society\
A maiden\'92s roar, wawawawawa\
A brand new cry, wawawawawa\
There really ain\'92t a man on the moon huh?\
Ao Voll is German, huh?\
A beat that makes you wanna eat curry so spicy you could die\
Ooh wee! Wane! Voll! Dies\
Gather round\
Ooh wee! Wane! Voll! Dies\
Mic check, HS Girl, one two\
HS Girl, one two\
Whatever\'92s okay, everyday\
Ooh wee! Wane! Voll! Dies\
Take a breath\
Ooh wee! Wane! Voll! Dies\
Sushi, ramen, beef bowl, pork cutlet, kishimen noodles\
I\'92ll eat whatever to this beat\
It\'92s always admirable to try and stand out!\
Burning instinct, gather round!\
Show off something completely original\
No worries let\'92s go, one man\'92s trash is treasure to some\
Ooh wee! Wane! Voll! Dies\
When you wanna cry...\
Ooh wee! Wane! Voll! Dies\
Crying is all right, let it all ou!\
Every day is a brand new day\
Ooh wee! Wane! Voll! Dies\
So, after that...\
Ooh wee! Wane! Voll! Dies\
You can resist all you want but you\'92ll smile for sure!\
Ooh wee! Wane! Voll! Dies! Everyday\
